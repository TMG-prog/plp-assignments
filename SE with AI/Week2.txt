1.
TensorFlow is an open-source platfrm used by data scientists, software developers and educators for machine learning using data flow graphs.
FEATURES
It is open-source that is freely available.
It is scalable hence supports small-scale and large-scale machine learning applications.
It supports multiple languages.
It offers pre-trained models via tensorflow Hub which allows fine-tuning models for specific tasks.

2.
TensorFlow builds a static computation graph before executing the model while
PyTorch builds a dynamic builds a static computation graph before executing the model.

3.
Keras is an open-source deep learning API written in Python.
It runs on TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit and Theano.

4.
 It is simple and efficient therefore easy-to-use API for beginners and experts.
 It has a wide range of algorithms which includes classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.
 It uses well-established python libraries e.g  NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib
 It allows for model selection and evaluation which provides cross-validation.

 5.
 Jupyter Notebooks provide an interactive environment for writing, running, and sharing code, especially in Python
 It has an interactive execution of code which allows one to see output immediately.
 It supposrts multiple languages such as Python and rangeIt allows for easy sharing of .ipynb files
 It works with machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlor and Scikit-Learn.

 6.
To prevent overfitting in the neural network by randomly dropping a fraction of the neurons during training.
